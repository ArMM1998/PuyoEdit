# PuyoEdit
Puyo Puyo Animation Editor

This is an animation editor for the ncsc format used by sega in Puyo Puyo games.
Games it supports:
Puyo Puyo 15th Anniversary
Puyo Puyo 7
Puyo Puyo 20th Anniversary
Puyo Puyo!! Quest
Puyo Puyo Touch

You'll need the `puyo_anim` script to convert the .json files into ncsc files used by these games and viceversa.
You can get it here:

Program does not support opening or saving directly to the binary nscs files, and i'm not sure if that's something i'm interested in doing either.
